# a-star-search
this folder contains the netbeans folder for an a-star search program 
a-star-search/a-star-search/build/classes/programming/assignment/pkg4/ contains the class files needed to run the program
once running the program in main, the prompt will ask for you to input an x and y coordinate, one-by-one, first for the starting coordinate, then for the end coordinate
after completing this the program will automatically generate a path (via a star) from the start to the end coordinate
